## Note

The actual dataset used for this project can be found at:

``ORIGINAL_TFG_files/codigos/workspaces/octo_ws/src/octo/scripts/data``

You can freely adjust the train/validation split percentage as needed. The original trainings were performed with a **95/5** split.

⚠️ **Important:** Remove the `dummy.npy` files before use. These placeholder files were added to allow the `./data/train` and `./data/val` directories to be committed to GitHub (since empty directories are not tracked by Git).
